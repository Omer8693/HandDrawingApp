# Real-Time Gesture-Controlled Drawing Interface ðŸŽ¨âœ‹

This project is a real-time gesture-controlled drawing and screen control interface powered by **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV**. Users can draw, erase, change brush thickness, switch themes, save, load, clear the canvas, and navigate UI icons â€” all through predefined hand gestures.

 ðŸš€ Features
- **9 predefined gestures** mapped to specific commands:
  - **Index finger up** â†’ Drawing mode
  - **Index + middle fingers up** â†’ Eraser mode
  - **Index + middle + ring fingers up** â†’ Switch to drawing mode
  - **All fingers open** â†’ Change theme (White, Gray, Black)
  - **Thumb up** â†’ Adjust brush thickness
  - **Thumb + pinky up** â†’ Save drawing
  - **Middle + ring + pinky up** â†’ Load drawing
  - **Fist (all fingers closed)** â†’ Clear canvas
  - **Index + middle fingers closed** â†’ UI icon navigation (Click)

- **Real-time performance** (25+ FPS)
- **Tested under three lighting conditions** (Bright, Normal, Dim)
- **Optional keyboard controls** for saving, loading, and thickness adjustment

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- **HandDrawingApp.ipynb** â†’ Interactive gesture-based drawing application
- **GestureTrainer.ipynb** â†’ Performance testing under various lighting conditions
- **data/** â†’ JSON files with performance measurements
- **saved_drawings/** â†’ Stored drawings

 ðŸ›  Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
   cd repository-name
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python mediapipe jupyter
   ```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook

4. Open and run `HandDrawingApp.ipynb`.

ðŸŽ¯ Usage
- Make sure your webcam is enabled.
- Hold your hand in front of the camera and perform a gesture.
- The drawing canvas will respond to your gesture in real-time.

ðŸ“Š Performance
- **FPS**: 25â€“33 across all gestures
- **Fastest recognition**: 1.6s (Click gesture)
- **Stable performance** across bright, normal, and dim lighting conditions
